## Problem

A manufacturing company I worked for wanted a tool to allow customers and homeowners to play with door options and get a realistic preview rendered. Other tools like this existed in the industry, but this company didnâ€™t have their own tool yet. Customers would often cite this a reason to switch to another manufacturer.

## Solution

A complex, mobile friendly form was created with AngularJS. This lets the user choose options such a door style, door color, etc. When a form change is detected, the selected options are sent to the backend. The backend then runs an image compositing script to pull various image assets together into a single image. This image is then returned to the front end.
