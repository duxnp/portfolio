This the documentation site for Bryan Kowal.

Bryan Kowal is a full stack web app developer with experience developing apps within an Nx monorepo. Front-end experience is primarily with Angular and all the various technologies that would entail including TypeScript, RxJS, NgRx, HTML, and SASS. Back-end experience includes Laravel and MySQL.

Believe it or not I actually enjoy writing unit tests using Jest and Cypress. I am also familiar with developing mobile apps with Ionic alongside web apps using the code sharing capabilities a monorepo affords.

I am currently interested in pursuing my career as a Web App Developer.

Previously developed .net desktop/console apps using C#, Crystal Reports, and SQL Server.

Additionally experienced using the Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft Office Suite.
