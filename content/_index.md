## Summary

Bryan Kowal here, I am a full stack web app developer with experience developing web and desktop apps. Front-end experience is primarily with Angular and all the various technologies that would entail including Nx, TypeScript, RxJS, NgRx, HTML, and SASS. Back-end experience includes Laravel, PHP, and MySQL.

While many programmers shy away from writing unit tests I tackle it full on. I use Jest and Cypress to test my Angular apps.

I have experience with developing web (Angular) and mobile (Ionic) apps together in the same workspace by using the code sharing capabilities a monorepo affords.

As my experience has evolved throughout my career, my interest has become more clearly defined in focussing on Web App Development.

Past experience includes:

- C# desktop/console apps
- SAP Crystal Reports
- SQL Server
- Adobe Creative Suite
- Microsoft Office Suite
